	<h1>Partnership</h1>
    <p>In certain church traditions, the term "partnership" is synonymous with what others may refer to as
        "membership." This is designed as a dynamic learning environment, providing an opportunity for us to explore
        and understand how we can faithfully identify tangible ways to live and grow in Christ together through a
        deeper commitment to Common Table and one another.</p>
